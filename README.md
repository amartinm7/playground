# playground

this repo is intended to play with the code and for technical tests.

It's personal wiki, where I can store code snippets, and other useful information.

## How to use

…or create a new repository on the command line
```bash
echo "# playground" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-github-user-goes-here/playground.git
git push -u origin main
```
…or push an existing repository from the command line
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-github-user-goes-here/playground.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
