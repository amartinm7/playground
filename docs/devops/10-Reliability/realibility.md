Reliability of a system is a measure of how resistant it is to failures of various types, for example attacks, disk or network failures. Which of the following are true?
Pick ONE OR MORE options
- Some companies disable parts of their system on purpose even on production. It is an extreme strategy. The idea to
make the system experience failures often and so have proof it can handle them well.
- Indexing is one of the fundamental approaches to making a system resistant to node failures.
- Redundancy can help mitigate node failures in the system.
- Some of the failures can be classified as either network failures, crash failures or Byzantine failures. The most difficult of these are Byzantine failures.


The correct statements are:

Redundancy can help mitigate node failures in the system. By having redundant components or replicas, the system can continue functioning even if some nodes fail.

Some of the failures can be classified as either network failures, crash failures, or Byzantine failures. Byzantine failures, which refer to arbitrary or malicious behavior by nodes or components, are generally considered the most difficult to handle.

The other statements are incorrect:

Some companies may intentionally introduce failures into their systems for testing or validation purposes, but it is not a common practice to disable parts of the system on purpose in production environments.

Indexing is not specifically related to making a system resistant to node failures. Indexing is a technique used to improve data access and retrieval efficiency, but it does not directly address system reliability or failure resistance.
