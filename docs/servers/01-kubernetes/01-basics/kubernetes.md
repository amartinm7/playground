## What is CPU Throttling

CPU throttling means that applications are granted more constrained resources when they are near to the containerâ€™s CPU limit. In some cases, container throttling occurs even when CPU utilization is not close to the limit due to bugs in the Linux kernel.

Consider a single-threaded application running on a limited CPU with a processing time of 200ms per operation. The following diagram shows an application that completes the request:

Now consider an application with a CPU limit of 0.4 CPUs. The application will only receive about 40ms of runtime for each 100ms. This means that instead of completing the request in 200ms, it will take a total of 440ms. This means the application is experiencing CPU throttling.

## Best practices for CPU limits and requests on Kubernetes

Lets summarize:

- Use CPU requests for everything (if you need help setting them, see KRR)
- Make sure they are accurate
- Do not use CPU limits.

`CPU limits` vs `memory limits` are different topics

## What about memory limits and requests?
Everything in this post is about CPU and not memory. Memory is different because it is non-compressible - once you give memory you can't take it away without killing the process. We've covered the best practices for Kubernetes memory limits here. In short, our bottom line recommendation is:

Always use memory limits
Always use memory requests
Always set your memory requests equal to your limitsS
