# Linux file system

![linux-file-system.jpeg](_img%2Flinux-file-system.jpeg)


/: The root directory where it all begins. Every other directory is a subdirectory of this one.

/𝗯𝗶𝗻: Contains fundamental binary files, necessary for minimal system functioning.

/𝘀𝗯𝗶𝗻: Similar to /bin, but contains binaries essential for system bootup and repair.

/𝗲𝘁𝗰: Holds system-wide configuration files. It's the go-to place for system administrators.

/𝗵𝗼𝗺𝗲: A personal space for users. Think of it as your work desk, containing your documents, downloads, and more.

/𝘃𝗮𝗿: Stores variable data files such as logs, emails, print queues, and most notably databases.

/𝘂𝘀𝗿: Holds user-related programs, libraries, and files.

/𝗹𝗶𝗯: Contains shared library files supporting the binaries in /bin and /sbin.

/𝗼𝗽𝘁: Optional or add-on software packages are located here.

/𝘁𝗺𝗽: A place for temporary files used by the system, cleared upon reboot.

/𝗯𝗼𝗼𝘁: All the files necessary for booting the system are here.

/𝗱𝗲𝘃: Contains device files for all hardware devices on the system.

/𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗰: An interesting directory that doesn't contain files but system and process information.

/𝗿𝗼𝗼𝘁: This is the home directory for the root user, not to be confused with the root (/) directory at the top of the filesystem.

/𝗿𝘂𝗻: This directory hosts temporary files (like /tmp) but these are specifically related to running processes and are created at an early stage of the boot process.

/𝘀𝗿𝘃: This directory contains data for services provided by the system.

/𝘀𝘆𝘀: Similar to /proc, this is a virtual filesystem providing a unified interface through which the kernel provides information about devices, drivers, and some kernel features.

/𝗺𝗻𝘁: This is a generic mount point under which you mount filesystems or devices.

/𝗺𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗮: This directory is generally used by the system as a mount point for removable media like CDs, digital cameras, or other media devices.

## Testing endpoints
doing an infinitive loop in single line (sleeping 1sec evrytime)
```bash
while sleep 1; do curl localhost:8080/v1 && curl localhost:8080/v2; done
